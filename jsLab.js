/********* NOTE: unsure which tile is which? Be sure to reference the HTML when you need to double-check! ************/


// 1. Tile 1 feels a little sad. 
// - Update the inner HTML to show an encouraging message! 
// - Something like "YOU GOT THIS!" or even a "You're a beautiful person!" 



// 2. Tile 2 has a button. 
// - Create a click event and have the background color of tile 2 change to a shade of green.
// - BE SURE TO SAVE THE BUTTON FIRST AS A VARIABLE.
// - Can you see if there's a way to toggle it???


// 3. What's this? A totoro? Where's his friends? 
// - Using createElement, create a friend (an image element).
// - Once created, set the src of it to the image address.
// - Append the element to tile 3. 
// - Need some inspiration? Go to giphy.com, search a character and choose the "stickers".


// 4. Oh no! A broken image! We need to fix this.
// - Set the src for tile 4 to have an image of your favorite TV show.




// These following tasks may require a little bit of digging. 
// Unsure how to complete the task? Use your resources! Code Nation reference table might help. 
// Can't find it there? Google search the keywords of what you're trying to do and use web dev documentation! 
// W3schools, MDN Web Docs, and Stack Overflow all super reliable 😊


// 5. Hmm. Looks like the font is too small. 
// - Update the font-size of tile 5 to 35 pixels.


// 6. Another sad box! 
// - Let make this tile 6 feel special and add a gradient background! 
// - What kind of gradient? What color? YOU CHOOSE!

// 7. Too many squares. 
// - Let's change tile 7 to have rounded edges - be sure to search for which CSS property does this :)

// 8. Replace the image with your favorite emoji. 
// - Try going to this site to search: https://emojipedia.org/

// 9. Display a random number in the tile when the button is clicked.
// - BE SURE TO SAVE THE BUTTON FIRST AS A VARIABLE.
